## R Console
```R
> citation()
To cite R in publications use:

  R Core Team (2023). _R: A Language and Environment for Statistical
  Computing_. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.
  <https://www.R-project.org/>.

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

  @Manual{,
    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
    author = {{R Core Team}},
    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
    address = {Vienna, Austria},
    year = {2023},
    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
  }

We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it
when using it for data analysis. See also ‘citation("pkgname")’ for
citing R packages.
```
This returns instructions for how to cite R in a publication(research paper or article).

Basic mathematical operations:
```R
> 4+5
[1] 9
> 5-4
[1] 1
> 10*2
[1] 20
> 10/2
[1] 5
>
